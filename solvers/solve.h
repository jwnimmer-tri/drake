 * @param initial_guess The initial guess for the decision variables.

 * For each option entry (like print out), there are 4 ways to set that option,

 * least, to highest / most):
 * 1. common option set on the MathematicalProgram itself
 * 2. common option passed as an argument to Solve
 * 3. solver-specific option set on the MathematicalProgram itself
 * 4. solver-specific option passed as an argument to Solve
 * @return result The result of solving the program through the solver.

/**
 * Solves a list of optimization programs in parallel. Optionally, an initial
 * guess can be provided for each optimization program, and a common set of
 * solver options can be used across the calls. This function will choose the
 * best available solver for each program individually depending on the
 * availability of the solver and the program formulation and so the programs in
 * @p prog_list can in general be of different type. The return is a list of
 * MathematicalProgramResult where the result of the iᵗʰ program is stored in
 * the iᵗʰ position of the return. If @p terminate_at_first_infeasible is set to
 * true, then this function will exit when any program returns infeasible. In
 * this case, if the iᵗʰ program is not solved, the iᵗʰ position of the return
 * will be std::nullopt.
 * @param prog_list A vector containing the formulation of the programs each of
 * which may possibly contain solver options.
 * @param initial_guesses A vector containing the initial guesses for the
 * decision variables. In the case that the user does not wish to provide a
 * guess for the iᵗʰ program, the iᵗʰ entry of initial_guesses is allowed to be
 * null. An empty vector is valid (and provides no guesses). A size-1 vector
 * is valid and will use that guess for all programs.
 * @param solver_options The options in addition to those stored in each program
 * of @p prog_list. For each option entry (like print out), there are 4 ways to
 * set that option, and the priority given to the solver options is as follows
 * (from lowest / least, to highest / most):
 * 1. common option set on each MathematicalProgram itself
 * 2. common option passed as an argument to each Solve
 * 3. solver-specific option set on each MathematicalProgram itself
 * 4. solver-specific option passed as an argument to each Solve
 * @param num_threads The number of threads used to solve the programs. If this
 * is less than or equal to 0, the number of threads is set to the hardware
 * concurrency limit.
 * @param terminate_at_first_infeasible Whether to exit this program early if
 * any of the programs in @p prog_list is infeasible.
 * @return result A vector of MathematicalProgramResult where the iᵗʰ position
 * contains the result of solving the iᵗʰ program in @p prog_list through the
 * solver. The iᵗʰ may be std::nullopt if the iᵗʰ program is not solved when @p
 * terminate_at_first_infeasible is true.
